                    <p>As discussed in the previous posts Smart Farming has a plethora of benefits but it also does have
                        various downsides and raises a number of questions. The first question I would like to discuss
                        is the question of who owns the data that is created through Smart farming. This is a common
                        issue in almost every industry involving the production of data and smart farming is no
                        exception, does the farmer who is utilizing the tools have access to the tools or own it? Does
                        the company that created the tool own the data? What are the regulations surrounding this
                        data?<sup>1</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we deal with data corresponding with users there are very strict bounds on what can and
                        what cannot be done. This makes sense especially when considering that a lot of user data has
                        important aspects that can potentially put a person in danger if not properly protected.
                        "Information privacy laws provide legal frame works on how to obtain user and store data of
                        natural persons"<sup>2</sup>. Examples of such laws within the US include the 1974 US Privacy
                        Act<sup>3</sup> or the 2002 Federal Information Security Management Act <sup>4</sup>
                        Regulations like these have no been put into place surrounding Smart Farming technology. The
                        fact that legislation has not yet been created makes sense since the immediate concerns that
                        arise with user data do not apply to the same extent when dealing with agricultural data but
                        that does not make this question any less important and until we find a solution we will not be
                        able to widely use such equipment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We need the government to create a regulatory system that does not give too much power to a
                        single stakeholder while also ensuring that those who get access to the data properly use it.
                        providing this data to a larger group we also open ourselves for the potential misuse of data
                        which itself will come with a large number of challenges. I propose that we create a system
                        where the company that creates the tool owns the data but is still required to share it with the
                        farmer. This is not an entirely new system, in Japan an Agricultural Data Collaboration Platform
                        WAGRI exists that provides a prublic source of data from farmers across the country.
                        <sup>10</sup>This will
                        help to safeguard against the shift that will come with the rise of Big Data
                        within farming of traditional and non-traditional stakeolders. <sup>5</sup>This would be
                        invoking
                        utilitarianism ethics since we are following this action for the
                        benefit of the masses at the expense of the single company that must share their collected data.
                        Despite the fact that some will experience the “reverse of happiness” this would still be the
                        right action to take as they promote happiness in the majority by promoting equality between the
                        stakeholders<sup>6</sup>. By sharing collected data we will create transparency within this
                        process which
                        will make it easier to deal with cases of errors or mismanagement.

                    <p>
                        In the space of Autonomous vehicles, a hotly contested topic is the question of who is at fault
                        in the case of an accident<sup>7</sup>, a similar question also exists in the arena of Smart
                        Farming. To
                        draw from an example from PNAS: If fungicide has been applied to plants too late and there are
                        traces remaining when the farmer goes to harvest who is at fault? Is it the farmer, the software
                        creator, or the creator of the sensor?<sup>8</sup> We can see how questions that deal with the
                        intersection
                        between machine learning, technology, and humans don’t have straightforward answers which means
                        that it will only be more and more difficult to create effective legislation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just as it is in the case of autonomous vehicles, time is of the essence in this case. The more
                        time spend delaying the creation of legislation to govern Smart Farming the higher chance that
                        we will not be able to create effective legislation. I recommend that in conjunction with the
                        grants suggested in the last blog post, a group is created within the government consisting of
                        both government officials as well as industry experts to discuss legislation. This group would
                        mimic the activites that U.S. Depeartment of Transportation ( USDOT) is taking to regulate
                        Automated Vehicles to ensure both the safety and to ensure that the US stays a key player in
                        the field<sup>9</sup>. I propose that for Smart Farming a similar group is greated within the
                        U.S.
                        Department of Agriculture to oversee smart farming activites and propose relevant legslislation.
                        I believe that this proposed group consisting of both engineers as well as government officials
                        would be able
                        to effectively navigate the intricacies of this field and the intersection between these fields.
