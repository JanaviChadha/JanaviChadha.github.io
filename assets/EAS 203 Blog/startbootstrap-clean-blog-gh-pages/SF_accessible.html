                    <p>Agriculture is a field that is often revolutionized by the invention of new technologies. We saw
                        this occur not too long ago with the widespread use of tools such as pesticides as well as
                        tractors in farming. While those tools come with their own individual challenges they are now an
                        integral part of the farming system and we would lose a significant part of the system if we
                        were to lose these technologies and inventions. The Smart Farming Revolution is shaping up to be
                        as big as these past revolutions if not bigger. Smart Farming allows farmers to reduce the usage
                        of materials as well as reduce the need for human labor. Smart farming builds upon the tools
                        from previous generations too, for example, there is a robot that is able to use vision software
                        to detect plants, and use highly pressurized canisters of positives to deliver pesticides
                        directly to the plant eliminating the need for systems where helicopters or airplanes deposit
                        pesticides over field leading to mass runoff of the excess and eventually leading the ecosystem
                        destruction with Algae Blooms and other such problems. Below is an image of this machine, the
                        See and Spray, along with an image explaining how it functions.</p>
                    <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/see-spray-img.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Image of the See and Spray a machine the utilizes machine learning
                        to detetect weeds and delive accurate jets of pesticides into the ground</span>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Slide ocvering how the See and Spray functions</span>
                    <p>To achieve all of these benefits that come with smart farming requires the use of many machines
                        and very complicated algorithms that all come at a high cost and once the machines have been
                        created there is a need for constant internet connection so that data and be sent and stores and
                        the individual parts of the machine can communicate with each other. The limited number of
                        manufactures of such products also plays a role in their high cost of the consumers ( farmers ).
                        Since this technology deals with data though it will only become better as more machines are out
                        there collecting more data and as the machines get better more consumers ( farmers ) will adopt
                        it and the cycle will continue. </p>
                    <p>I would like to propose that to encourage the use of Smart Farming technologies that governments
                        provide subsidies to farmers to afford these technologies. And I would also like to propose that
                        the government make research grants available for studying and developing technologies related
                        to this field. Having the ability to produce more food and a lower cost is a prospect that would
                        be quite beneficial for the economy of any ground and we know from our modules that when the
                        government is able to support research into a specific field or idea then that field is able to
                        advance farther in that time period than they would without the support of the government. </p>
                    <p>
                        This legislation that would allow such grants to be possible would be similar to the Morril Acts
                        of 1862 and 1890 that funded educational incisions by providing them land that they could then
                        sell or utilize to establish “land-grant” colleges. These grants were provided to encourage the
                        teaching of “practical agriculture, science, military science, and engineering” this was all
                        done as a response to the industrial revolution. While the original Morril Act of 1862 provided
                        educational incisions with swaths of land the later Morril Act of 1890 provided cash instead of
                        land. I believe that we should follow a similar structure to the Morril Acts of 1890 and provide
                        colleges with grant money to fund research focusing on agricultural research as it relates to
                        data science and the internet of things. According to research done by SUNY, it was found that
                        the land grant college system was a “major contributor in the faster growth rate of the US
                        economy that led to its overtaking the United Kingdom as an economic superpower”. Recreating a
                        system during a quite similar time in history would provide us with great economic benefits
                        adding to the sustainability of Smart Farming according to Herket’s definition of
                        Sustainability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, I propose that to ensure that the findings from this research are of benefit to all,
                        the government ensures the findings from the research exist in the public domain and companies
                        have the ability to take the research and create technologies based on them. The reason for this
                        is to try and ward against the possibility of a monopoly being created in the smart farming
                        sector. By placing these findings in the public domain we can ensure that larger companies with
                        access to more money for R&D don’t have an extreme advantage and we can encourage
                        competitiveness within the market.
