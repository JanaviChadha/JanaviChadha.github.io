                        Smart Farming is quite a popular buzzword right now but what is it and why should we use it?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Smart Farming is the process of using the internet of things and various other smart
                        technologies to make farming processes as efficient as possible. Allowing for the maximum
                        utilization of resources while reducing the need for human labor<sup>1</sup>. Examples of the
                        technologies
                        utilized within Smart Farming are water sensors, photosensors, temperature sensors among
                        others<sup>2</sup>.
                        These are utilized to collect data to then determine what nutrients and resources a plant needs
                        to
                        survive and produce it's resources ( fruit, grain, etc. )
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But why use Smart Farming over the current agricultural system that we have in place? To put it
                        simply our current agricultural system is wasteful. On average farms around the world account
                        for 70% of water usage and of that 40% is lost in the environment due to poor irrigation systems,
                        evaporation ,and overall poor water management<sup>3</sup>. With smart farming a plant is only
                        provided with the nutrients it needs to survive to produce the product we need. This means that
                        extra
                        materials such as pesticides or fertilizers are not given in excess and wanted and the materials
                        such as water can instead be re-routed for other uses such as human consumption or to grow more
                        plants.
                        Smart farming as well as reducing the use of materials reduces the need for human labor
                        automating many processes such as spacing and planting. When the work cannot be automated
                        everything is done at peak times in optimal conditions so no work is wasted. Combining both of
                        these factors to our benefit means that we have a great potential to reduce the harm that our
                        unsustainable farming practices have upon our planet. At this point agriculture accounts for
                        around 10% of annual greenhouse gas emissions according to the EPA <sup>4</sup>. By optimizing
                        all processes related to farming we will be able to reduce this percentage and help alleviate
                        the pressure that agriculture puts on
                        the global warming crisis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite these above benefits, incorporating Smart Farming into our current agricultural system
                        is much easier said than done. When considering the
                        current agricultural production chain there are many moving components and adding smart farming
                        will only make it more complicated. Within the simplified agricultural chain now we have the
                        producers who are the farmers, the government who regulates the producers and the consumers. For
                        the sake of simplicity, I will leave out the middlemen who buy the produce from the farmers and
                        then sell to stores that then sell to the consumers. When we bring smart farming into the chain
                        though we add on the companies who produce the technologies and will monitor the produce and
                        implement the necessary measures to ensure that the crops are growing healthy with the use of
                        the least resources. These are all of the stakeholders within our Smart Agricultural chain and
                        we need to ensure that each stakeholder gets their needs met but also that one stakeholder does
                        not have too much power over a certain aspect of this process. In the following blog posts, I
                        will outline my recommendations for the actions we should take to ensure that this does not
                        occur. This includes grants from the government encouraging research into Smart Farming as well
                        as updated and clearer legislation surrounding data and usages.
